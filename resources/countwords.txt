what
a
curious
feeling
said
alice
i
must
be
shutting
up
like
atelescopeand
so
it
was
indeed
she
was
now
only
ten
inches
high
and
her
facebrightened
up
at
the
thought
that
she
was
now
the
right
size
for
goingthrough
the
little
door
into
that
lovely
garden
first
however
shewaited
for
a
few
minutes
to
see
if
she
was
going
to
shrink
any
furthershe
felt
a
little
nervous
about
this
for
it
might
end
you
knowsaid
alice
to
herself
in
my
going
out
altogether
like
a
candle
iwonder
what
i
should
be
like
then
and
she
tried
to
fancy
what
theflame
of
a
candle
is
like
after
the
candle
is
blown
out
for
she
couldnot
remember
ever
having
seen
such
a
thingafter
a
while
finding
that
nothing
more
happened
she
decided
on
goinginto
the
garden
at
once
but
alas
for
poor
alice
when
she
got
to
thedoor
she
found
she
had
forgotten
the
little
golden
key
and
when
shewent
back
to
the
table
for
it
she
found
she
could
not
possibly
reachit
she
could
see
it
quite
plainly
through
the
glass
and
she
tried
herbest
to
climb
up
one
of
the
legs
of
the
table
but
it
was
too
slipperyand
when
she
had
tired
herself
out
with
trying
the
poor
little
thingsat
down
and
criedcome
theres
no
use
in
crying
like
that
said
alice
to
herselfrather
sharply
i
advise
you
to
leave
off
this
minute
she
generallygave
herself
very
good
advice
though
she
very
seldom
followed
itand
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
as
to
bring
tears
intoher
eyes
and
once
she
remembered
trying
to
box
her
own
ears
for
havingcheated
herself
in
a
game
of
croquet
she
was
playing
against
herselffor
this
curious
child
was
very
fond
of
pretending
to
be
two
peoplebut
its
no
use
now
thought
poor
alice
to
pretend
to
be
twopeople
why
theres
hardly
enough
of
me
left
to
make
one
respectablepersonsoon
her
eye
fell
on
a
little
glass
box
that
was
lying
under
the
tableshe
opened
it
and
found
in
it
a
very
small
cake
on
which
the
wordseat
me
were
beautifully
marked
in
currants
well
ill
eat
it
saidalice
and
if
it
makes
me
grow
larger
i
can
reach
the
key
and
if
itmakes
me
grow
smaller
i
can
creep
under
the
door
so
either
way
illget
into
the
garden
and
i
dont
care
which
happensshe
ate
a
little
bit
and
said
anxiously
to
herself
which
way
whichway
holding
her
hand
on
the
top
of
her
head
to
feel
which
way
it
wasgrowing
and
she
was
quite
surprised
to
find
that
she
remained
the
samesize
to
be
sure
this
generally
happens
when
one
eats
cake
but
alicehad
got
so
much
into
the
way
of
expecting
nothing
but
outofthewaythings
to
happen
that
it
seemed
quite
dull
and
stupid
for
life
to
goon
in
the
common
wayso
she
set
to
work
and
very
soon
finished
off
the
cake
